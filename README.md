Brutal Doom v20c Vanilla Edition
------------------------------

This is a vanilla edition of Sergeant Mark’s Brutal Doom v20b 
with appropriate fixes from drfrag’s v20c unofficial patch. 
Why v20b, you may ask? Well, because it’s all about the vanilla feel 
and gameplay plus Brutal Doom’s gore and selected effects. 
v20b was the last version where the sound effects of the monsters 
were like in vanilla, and the overall feel in classic mode
was pretty vanilla too, only the stats and some custom stuff were not. 
So what have I done? I stripped everything out that isn’t vanilla. 
This means no captured marines, no new weapons, no altered monsters,
no altered damage output of anything, no new Nazis, no onliners, 
no “fuck you,” no cringe stuff, nothing. 
Just plain vanilla gameplay with fully working Brutal Doom gore. 
But yeah, there are some minor differences for the sake of keeping all gore effects in.

-Headshots are still possible
-Barrells explode still way too heavy (those gibs are too satisfying)
-Super Shotgun does +15 fixed damage, needed for some gore effects to trigger, so I lowered pellets from 20 to 19
-Pistol, Chaingun and Shotgun have a minor vertical spread of 0.6 (0 is vanilla)


You can say I took one step further than bdlite gameplaywise and one step back in keeping every gore effect in.
